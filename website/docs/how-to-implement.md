# Implementing the API

Do you wish to provide your own implementation of the API? The Open Meal API is open to any organisation with meal information to implement. Simply read through the API documentation on this site and implement an API that follows the specification.

Note the following requirements:

- Implement the API endpoints that are listed in the specification
  - Mandatory fields in responses must be set
  - Mandatory parameters in requests must be implemented
  - Types must be respected
  - HTTP status codes must be followed
- All responses should be UTF-8 encoded.
- Publishing data via the Open Meal API means that it become available under the [Creative Commons Zero](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) license.

It is the responsiblity of the provider that the API is implemented correctly and to support any developers that reports bugs or has questions about the implementation of the Open Meal API.

You can use the [API specification](/openapi-specification) to generate code by using for example Swagger Codegen to get started quickly.
