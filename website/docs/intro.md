# Introduction

The goal for Open Meal is to facilitate a way for municipalities and organisations to openly share menus from their meal distributors (schools, retirement homes and more). Data is shared through [Data providers](/docs/api/data_providers) and can be consumed by third-party developers to build custom applications on top of it.

The Open Meal API consists of two parts:

- A REST [API](/docs/api/specification) returning data in JSON format
- An [iCalendar](/docs/api/icalendar) feed with a subset of the information. The feed can be used by smartphones and pads as well as other calendar software to subscribe to the information.
